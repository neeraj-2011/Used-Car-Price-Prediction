# Used-Car-Price-Prediction
## Car price prediction has picked researchers' interest since it takes a significant amount of work and expertise on the part of the field expert. For a dependable and accurate forecast, a large number of unique attributes are analysed. We employed 6 different machine learning approaches to develop a model for forecasting the price of used automobiles. The respective performances of different algorithms were then compared to discover the one that best suited the existing data set. The final prediction model was implemented in a python programme. Furthermore, the model was tested with test data, yielding an accuracy of 87.76 percent.
# Problem statement
## With the Coronavirus sway on the lookout, we have seen lot of changes in the vehicle market. Presently some vehicles are sought after subsequently making them exorbitant and some are not popular consequently less expensive. With the adjustment of market due to Coronavirus 19 effect, people/sellers are facing issues with their past Car Price valuation AI/Machine Learning models. Along these lines, they are searching for new AI models from new information. Here we are building the new car price valuation model.The primary point of this venture is to create a dataset with the help of web scraping and anticipate the cost of trade-in vehicle in view of different elements.
# Collecting the data
## We have scraped the data for over 5000 cars using Selenium script from 4 different websites from different different locations around the country. The websites are as followed:
       1. OLX
       2. Cars24
       3. CarDekho
       4. Autoportal 
# Limitations of this work and Scope for Future Work
## As a part of future work, we aim at the variable choices over the algorithms that were used in the project. We could only explore two algorithms whereas many other algorithms which exist and might be more accurate. More specifications will be added in a system or providing more accuracy in terms of price in the system i.e.
 1) Horsepower 
2) Battery power 
3) Suspension 
4) Cylinder 
5) Torque
